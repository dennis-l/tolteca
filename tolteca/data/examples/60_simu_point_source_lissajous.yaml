# An example config for simulating a point source catalog with
# lissajous mapping pattern.
#
# This config is used to make simulated image of a point source
# catalog created externally by Itziar Aretxaga.
#
# The field is about 5 arcmin^2 large, falling into the category of using
# a lissajous pattern.
#
# For the sources list, we added the point source catalog, as well
# as the toltec_power_loading with the static atmosphere model atm_q50

# Dict under "simu" key defines the tolteca.simu config.
# Consult 00_config_dict_references.rst for the schema.
simu:
  # The identifier of this job.
  # This jobkey is used to identify the simulator run.
  # In particular, it is used as the output directory name for the simulated
  # data files. It is also used by the DPDB to identify the source of
  # the data products.

    # the catalog needs to one of the readable format by
    # `astropy.table.Table`. The catalog shall also have column names
    # defined for each column. These names are used in the *_col keys
    # to indicate what information each column has.

    # The pos_col specify the columns to be used as the position of

    # coordinate frame such as ['az', 'alt'] for AltAz.
    pos_cols: ['ra', 'dec']
    # The data_cols defines the columns of source fluxes. Inline templates
    # are supported to specify multiple data_cols in one single entry.

    # to:
    # - colname: 'flux_a1100'

    # The atmosphere model can be null, one of am_q{25,50,75}, or toast.

    # telescope is still applied.
    # The am_q25, am_q50, and am_q75 are static atmosphere models
    # without fluctuation. The toast atm makes use the TOAST3 package for
    # creating realistic atmosphere including the fluctuations.

    # The "exposure" time of the simulation.
    # It can be in time unit like 1h or 40min, in this case the observation
    # is conducted for the given length. However, be aware that if the t_exp
    # is longer than the time needed to execute the full mapping pattern,
    # the behavior is undefined, especially for the raster and rastajous
    # patterns.
    # Specifying the t_exp as null will allow the simulator to simulate
    # the entire mapping pattern. This is recommended for raster and rastajous
    # patterns to ensure the pattern gets executed in its full.
    #
    # Note that the mapping pattern length is less well-behaving for
    # Lissajous patterns, depending on the ratio of the angular frequencies
    # of the x and y direction, therefore t_exp is recommented to specify
    # the length of observation.
