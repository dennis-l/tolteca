# An example config for simulating coverage and SNR of a blank field,
# with raster mapping pattern.
#
# This config is used to prototyping the observation strategy of the
# ECDFS field, one of the several TolTEC LSS fields.
#
# The field is about 10 deg^2 large, falling into the category of using
# a raster scan pattern.
#
# We do not put any real astronomical sources in the `sources` list, but
# we do enable the source of type `toltec_array_loading`, which simulates
# the power loading from atmosphere (the smooth component) and various
# components on the optical path. This introduces realistic photo noise
# and the simulated data can be used to check the expected depth/SNR.

# Dict under "simu" key defines the tolteca.simu config.

  # The identifier of this job.
  # This jobkey is used to identify the simulator run.
  # In particular, it is used as the output directory name for the simulated
  # data files. It is also used by the DPDB to identify the source of
  # the data products.

    # The "exposure" time of the simulation.
    # It can be in time unit like 1h or 40min, or in unit of "ct",
