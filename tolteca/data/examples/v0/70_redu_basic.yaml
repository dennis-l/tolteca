# An example config for running the reduction for simulated data
reduce:
  # The identifier of this job.
  # This jobkey is used to identify the simulator run.
  # In particular, it is used as the output directory name for the simulated
  # data files. It is also used by the DPDB to identify the source of
  # the data products.
  jobkey: reduced
  # The input list.
  # This interface is quite flexible in its form. The tolteca will look into
  # each entry and find out what kind of data it holds (with the help of
  # the DPDB, if available), and automatically compose the raw_obs data product
  # to be used as input to the reduction.
  inputs:
    # Here we only have one item in the input list, which is set to be a
    # path which holds simulated data (see 60_simu_point_source_lissajous.yaml).
    # the simulated data files are indexed by DPDB, and the simualted data
    # with the latest obsnum will be used as the input.
    - path: dsfg_simu

  # Here we define the details of the pipeline engine.
  pipeline:
    # The pipeline engine name. For TolTEC data, this is citlali.
    name: citlali
    # The rest of the keys (in this case, only one key word "config") are
    # related to the engine we choose. Each of the engine has its own
    # interface class that consumes the dict. For citlali, this is
    # `tolteca.reduce.toltec.Citlali`.
