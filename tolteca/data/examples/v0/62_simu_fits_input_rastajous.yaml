# An example config for making simulation with FITS image as input.
#
# This config also demonstrate the use of the rastajous pattern.
#
# The field is about 12' by 12', falling into the category of using
# a rastajous pattern.

# Dict under "simu" key defines the tolteca.simu config.

  # The identifier of this job.
  # This jobkey is used to identify the simulator run.
  # In particular, it is used as the output directory name for the simulated
  # data files. It is also used by the DPDB to identify the source of
  # the data products.
