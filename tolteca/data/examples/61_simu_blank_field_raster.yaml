# An example config for simulating coverage and SNR of a blank field,
# with raster mapping pattern.
#
# This config is used to prototyping the observation strategy of the
# ECDFS field, one of the several TolTEC LSS fields.
#
# The field is about 10 deg^2 large, falling into the category of using
# a raster scan pattern.
#
# We do not put any real astronomical sources in the `sources` list, but
# we do enable the source of type `toltec_power_loading`, which simulates
# the power loading from atmosphere (the smooth component) and various
# components on the optical path. This introduces realistic photo noise
# and the simulated data can be used to check the expected depth/SNR.

# Dict under "simu" key defines the tolteca.simu config.
# Consult 00_config_dict_references.rst for the schema.

  # The identifier of this job.
  # This jobkey is used to identify the simulator run.
  # In particular, it is used as the output directory name for the simulated
  # data files. It is also used by the DPDB to identify the source of
  # the data products.

    # The atmosphere model can be null, one of am_q{25,50,75}, or toast.
    # When null, the atm model is disabled, but the power loading from the
    # telescope is still applied.
    # The am_q25, am_q50, and am_q75 are static atmosphere models
    # without fluctuation. The toast atm makes use the TOAST3 package for
    # creating realistic atmosphere including the fluctuations.

    # The "exposure" time of the simulation.
    # It can be in time unit like 1h or 40min, in this case the observation
    # is conducted for the given length. However, be aware that if the t_exp
    # is longer than the time needed to execute the full mapping pattern,
    # the behavior is undefined, especially for the raster and rastajous
    # patterns.
    # Specifying the t_exp as null will allow the simulator to simulate
    # the entire mapping pattern. This is recommended for raster and rastajous
    # patterns to ensure the pattern gets executed in its full.
    #
    # Note that the mapping pattern length is less well-behaving for
    # Lissajous patterns, depending on the ratio of the angular frequencies
    # of the x and y direction, therefore t_exp is recommented to specify
    # the length of observation.
